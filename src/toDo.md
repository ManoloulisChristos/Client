1. Check the request for the ratings that is being used in the moviesList and each card and mayber i can write it better and use only a single
   request for both the movies list and the user ratings page!

2. Error!!! When i am in the ratings for too long and i go elsewhere and try to go back i get a session expired please sign in error!

3. Make the ratingModal star the same color with the star outside (maybe?) and make the black theme with white inside and catch the localStorage value no event listeners.
